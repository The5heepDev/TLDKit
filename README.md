# TLDKit


This is a mod kit for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


This is a simple api for mods to 
 - Load custom assets into the game
 - Add icons to the game map

 
The list of uses is ever growing, and should have backwards compatability between versions.
 
 
Requires the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) to run.
